# Project description:

Project objectives: Optimization of production processes through the construction of a model that predicts the temperature of the steel. The target metric of this study is MAE

## Tools and skills:
machine learning, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, data visualization, pandas

## Conclusions:
The result of this study was a CatBoostRegressor model trained on 28 signs, it is capable of predicting the temperature of the ladle heating with an error of MAE 5.9, which corresponds to the purpose of the study.
