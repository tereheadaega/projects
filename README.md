# My projects from Yandex Practicum
 
 This repository contains projects I have done under Yandex Practicum

On base of Yandex Practicum data science program I've learned to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights and on a base such data create predictive models.

I am developing proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib). In machine learning I have experience in models of decision tree and random forest, linear regression, CatBoost and LGBM. Also I had a course of SQL.

This repository contains over ten projects about machine learning and data analysis.
